<h4><a title="Bunsen on GitHub" href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/bunsen">Bunsen</a></h4>
<p>An advanced, object-oriented program execution library for PHP. It is an attempt to combine and
extend the functionality of PHP's built-in program execution functions (i.e. exec, shell_exec,
system, passthru, etc.) to give you extremely flexible, yet extremely precise and consistent control
over input/output, timing, piping, exit codes, etc. It is meant to be a simple, yet comprehensive
library for executing (and interacting with) external programs in a UNIX/Linux environment.</p>

<h4><a title="CFPG on GitHub" href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/cfpg">Carpus Friendly Password Generator</a></h4>
<p>Uses a quantitative typing effort model to generate secure passwords that are measurably
easy-to-type (a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus" rel="nofollow">carpus</a>
friendly) on standard QWERTY keyboards. It works by generating a random password, and then replacing
random characters until the overall typing effort of the password is below the desired value.
There's currently a <a href="http://jnrbsn.github.com/cfpg">web interface</a> written in JavaScript
(in the gh-pages branch of the git repository) and a PHP function for integration with your apps (in
the master branch). I plan on porting it to other language as time allows. if you want to contribute
a port in an additional language, you can fork the <a href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/cfpg">GitHub
project</a> and submit a pull request.</p>

<h4><a title="Rowlf on GitHub" href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/rowlf">Rowlf</a></h4>
<p>A PHP coding standard that can be used with PHP_CodeSniffer to validate PHP files and detect
violations in coding style. For now, it's basically a combination of the PEAR and Squiz coding
standards with a few tweaks here and there.</p>

<h4><a title="srch4.it on GitHub" href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/srch4.it">srch4.it</a></h4>
<p>A simple, fast, intuitive search engine written in pure JavaScript and powered by the Google Web
Search API. See the <a href="https://github.com/jnrbsn/srch4.it#readme">README on GitHub</a> for
details. A live demo is available at &lt;<a href="http://srch4.it">http://srch4.it</a>&gt;.</p>
