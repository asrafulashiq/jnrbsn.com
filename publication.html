<h2>Publication</h2>

<p> 
    Currently I do not have any published paper yet. I have one paper  on Voice Recongnition submitted in ICECE 2016 . I am also working on some projects which will most probably result in some publications. For instance, I am working on a journal publication under Dr. Mohammad Ariful Haque on pole-matching estimation technique. We may submit this paper very soon in a famous journal. My undergraduate thesis work under Prof. Md. Kamrul Hasan would likely produce a journal publication.
