            <h3>Medical Assistive Robot</h3>
            <p>
                Medical Assistive Robot is a control system laboratory project submitted by six students of department of EEE at BUET , in which I was an active member. This project was a combination of signal processing, control system and electronics. We had to use different voice processing algorithms, PID controller algorithm and micro-processor concepts.</p>

            <h3>Synchronous Machine</h3>
            <p>
                A synchronous machine is an AC rotating machine whose speed, under steady state condition is proportional to the frequency of armature current. Synchronous machines are commonly used as generators, especially for large power systems, such as turbine generators and hydroelectric generators in the grid power supply. Synchronous motors require DC excitation which must be supplied from external sources. Synchronous motors are inherently not self-starting motors and needs some arrangement for its starting and synchronizing. Now we have to set a dc field on the rotor of a synchronous machine. Although stator of synchronous machine is same to that of an induction motor which is available in the market, we had to modify our rotor. It was a difficult job as we did not have any equipment to cut the iron core of the rotor. Finally we took help of a workshop to cut the rotor. The rest of the works were done by solely us.
