                        <li>
                            implemented neural network system using python framewroks Neurolab and Theano for classification of power signatures and tested that neural network does not work well on this particular classification problem.

                        <li>
                            learned to use various frameworks like numpy,scipy,scikit-learn,LibSVM for classification.
                        </li>
                            
                         <li>
                            implemented SVM classification system using scikit-learn with RBF kernal. First tried with NuSVC and LinearSVC kernal, but these did not perform well. Later did some data pre-processing like normalization and used RBF kernal that did a boost in accuracy - 25%  by Neural Network to 60% accuracy by SVM.

                         <li>
                            built an MATLAB app with responsive user interface. The app included training , testing, calculating accuracy and plotting spectral information in power and audio data.
                                
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            used KNN algorithm in our novel distance-based pole-matching algorithm that resulted in 90% accuracy and great speed boost for real time analysis.
