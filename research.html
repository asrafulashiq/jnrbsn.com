                        This is my undergraduate thesis work under Prof. Dr. Md. Kamrul Hasan. I had to remove motion artifact and estimate heart rate from PPG signal obtained during intense physical exercise. Lots of works have been done on heart rate monitoring from PPG signal, but most of them work well on patients not doing any physical activity. While running or moving hands arbitrarily, the previous methods fail to estimate heart bit correctly. To obtain correct heart rate, I have been exploring different methods, which include the following -

                            <h4>Parametric Spectrum Estimation</h4>
                            <p>
                                I investigated different parametric spectral estimation techniques like MUSIC,burge, pissarenko for PPG data. I have found that fourier analysis is not a good estimattion technique for PPG data. I had to use parametric spectrum estimation techniques. I found out that burg estimation with high model order works well on PPG signal.

                            <h4> Frequency sparsity in RLS </h4>
                            <p>
                                It was assumed that clean PPG data would be sparse in frequency domain. To exploit this sparsity constraint, I did modify RLS cost function. I added a sparsity constraint in fourier domain in the rls cost function, and then calculated gradient of it. Applying matrix calculus and some trivial assumptions, I found an adaptive algorithm with this new cost function. I have calculated gradient using L0, L1, L2 norm of the fft of the error signal. Implementing this new algorithm in PPG data, I found out that PPG signal with intense motion artifacts does not exhibit the necessary sparsity in frequency domain.

                        <h4>Denoising Techniques</h4>
                        <p>
                            tested different denoising techniques using wavelet transform and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition.

                        I had to collaborate on building an intelligent system that could recognize different grid locations from media recordings. Initially we started working for winning the Signal Processing Cup competition arranged by IEEE Signal Processing Society. But after winning the competition, I, along with some other members of the team, continued to work on improving our methods. There were mainly two major divisions in our group - one was spectrum estimation and feature extraction group, and the other was classification group. I was mainly involved in classification task.

                            implemented SVM classification system using scikit-learn with RBF kernal. First tried with NuSVC and LinearSVC kernal, but these did not perform well. Later did some data pre-processing like normalization and used RBF kernal that did a boost in accuracy - 25%  by Neural Network to 60% accuracy by SVM.
